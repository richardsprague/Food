Make tortillas yourself is easy, but requires much practice.

Inspired by [a tweet](https://twitter.com/jmreagle/status/1499747993611907076) from Joseph Reagle and [Jauja Cocina Mexicana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzKuWBDDLPg&t=209s) on YouTube, I’ve slowly been improving my skill at making homemade corn tortillas.

When you learn the *essence* of something, you can do it anywhere, with minimal equipment and basic ingredients. My goal is to master the *essence*.

A few tips I’ve learned so far.

The flatter and thinner the better, but not so thin that they fall apart. That’s tricky. I found that I can get pretty close to ideal by covering two dinner plates with plastic wrap which I then push together as hard as possible. This worked better than a rolling pin, which I found made the dough too difficult to keep together.

The thinness is important for getting that “fluffy” look that happens when the fresh dough hits the pan.
