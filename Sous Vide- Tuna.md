same thing, oniy without sous vide. After an hour marinating, I put it in the oven at 450ºF for about 2-3 minutes each side, flipping in the middle. Then another 2-3 minutes blasting with the broiler, checking the temperature with my thermometer. Internal temp of a little over 120.

Serve with broccoli and a cream sauce made of:
