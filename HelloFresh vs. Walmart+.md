HelloFresh vs. Walmart+

Meal kit delivery services are a convenient way for busy individuals or families to cook healthy and delicious meals at home. HelloFresh is one such service that has emerged as a popular option, delivering pre-portioned ingredients and easy-to-follow recipes straight to customers' doorsteps. But are they worth the trouble compared to a simple grocery delivery services like Walmart+?  Here is my comparison.

HelloFresh costs about \$75 for a box of 4 meals of 2 servings each. Roughly, each meal is about \$15 - \$20 for two people. Because many of the recipes contain single-serve items that aren't typically sold individually, it's hard to calculate the costs if you purchased the ingredients at the grocery store.

But generally speaking, buying it yourself will be dramatically cheaper, especially as you become used to cooking with a variety of ingredients and learn to creatively reuse excess ingredients originally needed for previous meals.

## Example: Pork Chops

[Balsamic Rosemary Pork Chops](https://www.hellofresh.com/recipecards/card/balsamic-rosemary-pork-chops-62cd9f4a1f3e189fe50f7012-4559dcb7.pdf) is a typical HelloFresh meal

I can reproduce this recipe for under \$10 total, using ingredients freshly purchased and augmented with bulk items we already have on hand.

- Green beans \$2
- Pork chops \$6
- Garlic bread (leftover)
- Rosemary (dried spices on hand)
- Balsamic vinegar (big bottle on hand)
- Chicken stock concentrate (on hand)

Each of the on-hand ingredients costs far less than \$1 depending on how you amortize the costs.

HelloFresh gives reassuring step-by-step instructions, but once you've done meals like this a few times, you won't need the notes anyway. Plus, you may find it easy and convenient to apply substitutes, or shift the amounts to suit your tastes or appetite.
