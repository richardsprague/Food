Brussels sprouts are a delicious and nutritious vegetable that can boost your health and flavor your dishes. They are rich in fiber, vitamin C, and vitamin K, and have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Try them roasted, sautéed, or raw in salads.

## Oaxacan-Inspired Italian Sausage and Brussels Sprouts with Mole Sauce

2023-08-02 6:29 AM
Although this was a good way to get rid of some refrigerator leftovers, and mole always tastes rich and worthwhile, I don't recommend this dish. It needs something else to be more inspired.


This dish combines the earthy, complex flavors of a traditional Mexican [mole sauce](Mole.md) with hearty Brussels sprouts and Italian sausage.

### Ingredients

Italian sausage, Brussels sprouts, mole paste (either store-bought or homemade with ingredients like chili peppers, chocolate, almonds, sesame seeds, cinnamon, and cloves), chicken broth, onions, garlic, and cilantro for garnish.

### Instructions

In a large pan, cook the Italian sausage until browned. Remove and set aside. In the same pan, sauté the onions and garlic until they're fragrant and the onions are translucent. Add your mole paste and chicken broth, stirring until you have a rich, smooth sauce. Add the Brussels sprouts and cooked sausage, allowing everything to simmer together until the Brussels sprouts are tender and have absorbed some of the sauce. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.
