title: 'Blue Apron: Sheet Pan Spicy Maple-Mustard Salmon'

From [Blue Apron](https://www.blueapron.com/recipes/sheet-pan-spicy-maple-mustard-salmon-with-roasted-sweet-potato-peppers-snap-peas)

The secret is the topping for the fish. 

## Ingredients
- Mustard
- Mayonnaise
- Maple Syrup
- Red pepper flakes
- Bread crumbs

## Directions
combine mustard, mayonnaise, maple syrup, and as much of the red pepper flakes as you'd like and apply it to the top of the fish.  Then cover it with bread crumbs and pat it all down.

Finally, set it in the oven for about 15-20 minutes.

The nice thing is you can bake other items at the same time. For example, put in some [Bread](Lekue Silicone Bread Maker.md) at 6pm, some hard vegetables like broccoli or bell peppers at 6:10, add the fish at 6:20 and the whole thing is done around 6:30.
