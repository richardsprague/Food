## Hummus (Plain)

2023-04-24: this turned out way too thick. Next time add the chickpeas slowly and adjust for consistency.

### Ingredients

- 1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas  *or 1 ½ cups (250 grams) cooked chickpeas*
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh lemon juice,  *1 large lemon*
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) well-stirred tahini 
- 1 small garlic clove, minced
- 2 tablespoons (30 ml) extra-virgin olive oil,  *plus more for serving*
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- Salt to taste
- 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 ml) water
- Dash ground paprika or sumac,  *for serving*

### Directions

Mix the tahini and lemon juice first, then olive oil, minced garlic, cumin
Open, drain, and rinse the chickpeas. Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for 1 minute.

**Important**: save the liquid from the chickpeas can ("aquafaba") and use that to adjust the final consistency.
