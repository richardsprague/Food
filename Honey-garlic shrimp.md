Inspired by [Butter Your Biscuit](https://butteryourbiscuit.com/honey-garlic-butter-shrimp-broccoli/)

Serve on top of couscous made with a rich broth concentrate (e.g. beef) and stir-fried paneer.


***

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup honey
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled, deveined and tails removed if desired
- 2 tablespoon butter
- 2 cups chopped broccoli
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- salt pepper

## Principles

Use lots of honey (2x the other ingredients) and marinate for 30+ minutes before cooking.  In the above recipe, use about 1/3 for the marinade, and (important) discard. This is too much sauce and will end up soupy.

Stir-fry the vegetables (or whatever else in the mix) first. Then remove from the pan and add again at the very end -- with the remaining marinade.

I substituted Yuzu because I didn't have ginger.
