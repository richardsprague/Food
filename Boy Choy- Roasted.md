This works reasonably well. I tried braising the bok choy under the broiler for a few minutes...not sure if it did much good.


## Sauce

- 2 tablespoons less sodium soy sauce
- 1 tablespoons water
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Asian sweet chili sauce
- 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger
- 1/8-1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
