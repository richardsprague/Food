Needs pork, onions, Brussels sprouts quartered, frozen peas

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons grapeseed or olive oil
- 1½ pounds pork shoulder, diced into ½-inch pieces
- 3 medium onions, finely diced
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- ½ green bell pepper, seeded, stemmed and cut into ½-inch dice
- 3 carrots, cut into ½-inch pieces
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 (15-ounce) can of crushed tomatoes
- 2 cups chicken stock or water
- 1½ tablespoons fish sauce
- ½ tablespoon black peppercorns
- Kosher salt
- ¼ pound Brussels sprouts, quartered
- ½ cup frozen peas
- Steamed rice, for serving


## Instructions

1. Warm the oil in a heavy pot over medium-high heat. When hot, add pork. Sear on all sides until golden brown, about 7 minutes. (If necessary, work in batches to avoid crowding.)
2. Stir in onion, garlic, bell pepper, carrots and bay leaves. Sauté until onions soften, 3-5 minutes. Add tomato paste and stir to combine, about 30 seconds. Mix in crushed tomatoes, stock or water, fish sauce and peppercorns. Simmer, over medium-high heat. If the mixture begins to look dry, add a splash of water.
3. Meanwhile, bring a small pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the Brussels sprouts and blanch until soft and paler in color, about 3 minutes. Drain and toss dry.
4. When pork is almost tender, after simmering for about 20 minutes, stir in blanched Brussels sprouts. Continue cooking until pork is fully tender, about 10 minutes more. Add peas and simmer until plump and bright green, about 2 minutes. Serve over rice.
