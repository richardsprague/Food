Leftover Beijing duck makes a tasty soup stock

2023-06-22 7:43 AM

I chopped up the bones and roasted at 400ÂºF for about 45 minutes.

Then I plopped everything into the Instant Pot with about 6 cups of water (enough to comfortably submerge the bones).  I added some garlic salt and a bay leaf, plus some shakes of cardamom.

Instant Pot Manual High Pressure for 45 minutes.

The result is not very flavorful -- thank the lack of salt or other aromatics -- and more thin than I'd like.

I froze the remainder and will use it for future cooking.
