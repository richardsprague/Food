These eggs take much longer than through other methods, but little of it is hands-on time. The innovation I did was use a much smaller pot than normal.

## Directions

* 145ÂºF for 45 minutes
* Take out the eggs and crack them one at a time. You only need to open enough of the shell for the internals to drop out.
* Set the unshelled eggs in some simmering hot water for about a minute
