Inspired by [AllRecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11808/creamy-pesto-shrimp/) and [HelloFresh](https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/2018w51r14-chicken-and-spaghetti-alfredo-with-a-twist-5bdc544530006c54523e62c2), here's how I made a reasonably-successful cream sauce.

## Next Time
- Use sour cream instead of cream cheese?
- Use more italian seasoning

## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup Philadelphia cream cheese
- 1/2 cup whole cream
- 1/4 cup grated parmesan
- 1/4 cup pasta water

## Directions

1. Saut√© the shrimp (or whatever protein) in finely-chopped onions and garlic and set aside.
2. Add cream and cheese, letting the whole concoction boil down a little.
3. Return the shrimp at the last minute. Turn off heat and add a bunch of fresh spinach.
