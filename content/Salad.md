## Tomato Watermelon Salad
Use tomato, shredded cabbage, and watermelon for a simple makeshift salad.

There's enough liquid and sweetness in the watermelon so you don't have to add olive oil or even mayonnaise.  Just shake some dried mint and plenty of pepper plus a pinch of salt.

You might also dribble a bit of white wine vinegar
