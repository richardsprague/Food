title: Leek and potato soup
---


Chop leeks like you would scallions, until you have 2 cups worth.

Set the chopped leeks, along with some garlic, into a dutch oven and some melted butter. Add salt & pepper, and saut√© until reasonably tender. Then add a can of chicken stock, some diced potato, some thyme and a bay leaf.

Let the whole thing cook uncovered for about 20-30 minutes, until the potatoes are obviously tender. 

Blend the whole thing with an immersion blender.

Add some cream and let it simmer another 10 minutes to thicken up.

Consider adding some fried bacon at that point too.

enjoy!
