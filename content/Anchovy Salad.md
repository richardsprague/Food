# Anchovy Salad

2021-06-21
Inspired by [nomnompaleo](https://nomnompaleo.com/avocado-salad-with-garlic-anchovy-vinaigrette-keto-whole30) I tried making an anchovy-based salad dressing:

- 3 anchovies
- crushed garlic
- white white vinegar
- crushed garlic
- onion (shallot preferred)

But although the anchovies have an umami-heavy interesting taste, the entire concoction was not worth repeating.
