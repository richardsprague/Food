### Insights

Mix shredded meat, cheese, black beans, diced tomatoes, and spices and scoop into folded tortillas laid on a baking dish. Cover with enchilada sauce, then more cheese, then a dollop of more beans. Bake at 350ºF for 20-30  minutes and serve topped with sour cream.

* The key ingredient is enchilada sauce. You can make it yourself, but it's much easier if you just have a can or two on hand.
* Mix shredded meat and cheese with a little enchilada sauce
* Spread tinfoil on the pan for easier cleanup (though some tends to leak through)

Make it with shredded chicken or any kind of meat.  This time it was slightly under-flavored. Maybe consider dousing it with more chili powder or oregano.

- Oaxacan [mole sauce](Mole.md) 
- Fresh tomato
- Canned diced tomato
- Canned mushrooms
- Canned jalapeno
- Enchilada sauce

### Instructions

1. Rinse your soaked black beans and put them in your Instant Pot. Cover them with about 1 inch of water. Close the lid, set the vent to "Sealing," and cook on high pressure (Manual mode) for about 6-8 minutes. Let the pressure naturally release for about 10-15 minutes, then quick release any remaining pressure.

2. While the beans are cooking, prepare the rice according to the package instructions. Add a bit of cumin and a clove of garlic to the water for added flavor.

3. Slice the Andouille sausage into small chunks or thin slices. Sauté it in a skillet over medium heat until it's nicely browned and cooked through.

4. Once the beans are cooked and the pressure is released, drain the beans and set them aside. Add the drained beans to the skillet with the cooked sausage. Add the canned diced tomato, drained canned mushrooms, and some canned jalapeno (according to your heat preference). 

5. Slice the zucchini into small chunks or thin slices and add it to the skillet. Sauté everything together until the vegetables are tender and it's all warmed through. Season with your chosen spices to taste.

6. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). 

7. Lay a tortilla flat and spread a layer of rice down the middle. Top it with the sausage, bean, and vegetable mixture, and then sprinkle a generous amount of Mexican cheese on top. Roll it up and place it seam-side down in a baking dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling.

8. Once all your enchiladas are in the baking dish, pour the enchilada sauce evenly over the top. If you have any remaining filling, you can sprinkle it over the top as well, followed by another layer of cheese.

9. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the sauce is bubbling. 

10. After the initial baking, you can remove the foil and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.

11. Let the casserole rest for a few minutes before serving. You can garnish it with fresh tomato and a drizzle of Oaxacan [mole sauce](Mole.md) , if desired.
