title: Banana Chocolate Chip Cookies
---



The ripe banana can add moisture and natural sweetness to your cookies, allowing you to reduce added sugars. Here's a basic adjustment:

### Ingredients

Dry Ingredients: Use the standard base (flour, baking soda, salt).

Wet Ingredients: Replace about half of the butter or oil with mashed ripe banana.

Sugar: Reduce the sugar by 10-20% since the banana will add natural sweetness.

Flavor Enhancers: Add a pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg to complement the banana.

Also add walnuts or pecans

Texture: The cookies will be softer and more cake-like due to the banana.

### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Whisk together 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon baking soda.
3. In another bowl, mix 1/2 cup softened butter, 1/4 cup mashed ripe banana, 3/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/4 cup granulated sugar.
4. Add 2 eggs and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the wet mixture.
5. Combine wet and dry ingredients.
6. Fold in 2 cups of chocolate chips.
7. Place dollops on a baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes.
