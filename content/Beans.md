If you soak black beans overnight, empty the water and let them dry for a day or two, they will sprout. I discovered this by accident when I had soaked too many beans and wanted to save the rest for later. Technically known as a radicle, the tiny shoots that emerge from the bean “seed” are embryonic roots that, if left in soil, would eventually sprout into a full-blown bean plant.
