## Ingredients
For the Meatballs

- 1 pound ground pork
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1 ounce fresh breadcrumbs, or 2 ounces dried breadcrumbs
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 handful fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil


For the Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large onion, coarsely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- 2 (14-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
- 8 sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
- 1 cup red wine
- 1 handful fresh flat-leaf parsley, coarsely chopped
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Freshly grated parmesan cheese, for serving, optional

## Directions

Mix the meatballs and handroll them into about a dozen golf-sized balls. Place them on an oiled pan and get them nice and browned. Optionally, douse the pan with some chicken broth concentrate and maybe some balsamic vinegar.  

Saut√© the onions and garlic in the same saucepan you'll use for the tomato sauce. After they're nice and cooked, add the rest of the ingredients and let it boil for a while.

Finally, dump in the meatballs and let the whole concoction cook on low heat for as long as you like.
