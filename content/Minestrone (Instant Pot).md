title: Minestrone (Instant Pot)
---

Minestrone is a hearty Italian soup traditionally made with vegetables, often with the addition of pasta or rice. It is a versatile dish that can be adapted to suit seasonal vegetables and personal preferences. The soup is known for its robust flavor, often enhanced with a variety of herbs and spices.


### Ingredients

**Essential:**

- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 1 potato, peeled and cubed
- 3 cups tomato sauce
- 5 cups vegetable or chicken broth
- 1 can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
- Salt and pepper to taste

**Optional but Recommended:**

- 4 strips of bacon, diced
- 1 cup pre-cooked barley
- Olive oil for sautéing
- Fresh basil and/or oregano for garnish
- Parmesan cheese for serving

### Instructions:

1.  **Sauté Bacon**: Turn the Instant Pot to the sauté setting. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and the diced bacon. Cook until the bacon starts to crisp.
    
2.  **Sauté Vegetables**: Add the chopped onion, carrots, and garlic. Continue to sauté until the onions become translucent and the carrots begin to soften.
    
3.  **Add Potato**: Incorporate the cubed potato and stir for a couple of minutes.
    
4.  **Add Liquids**: Pour in the tomato sauce and vegetable or chicken broth. Stir well to combine.
    
5.  **Pressure Cook**: Seal the Instant Pot lid and set it to Manual or Pressure Cook on High for 7 minutes. This will allow the potato and other vegetables to cook through.
    
6.  **Quick Release**: Once the cooking time is up, perform a quick release to depressurize the Instant Pot.
    
7.  **Add Beans and Barley**: Stir in the cannellini beans and pre-cooked barley. Since these are already cooked, they just need to be heated through.
    
8.  **Heat Through**: Turn the Instant Pot back to the sauté setting and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat the beans and barley.
    
9.  **Season and Garnish**: Add salt and pepper to taste. You can also add some chopped fresh basil or oregano at this point.
    
10. **Serve**: Ladle the soup into bowls and top with grated Parmesan cheese.
    

### Cooking Notes:

- The Instant Pot significantly reduces the cooking time, especially for the potatoes.
- Since the barley is pre-cooked, it's added at the end to avoid becoming mushy.
