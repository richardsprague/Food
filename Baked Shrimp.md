The basic process: lightly sauté some thawed shrimp with a few spices. Remove from the skillet when they are just slightly pink.

Set a layer of spinach at the bottom of a tinfoiled oven pan. Drop the spinach on top, along with other ingredients like diced sweet potato and pinto beans.

Pour enchilada sauce over it and top with mexican cheese.

Bake in the oven at 375ºF for 20 minutes.

Next time be more liberal with spices

I first sautéd some diced sweet potato for 10 minutes.

Then I partially unthawed a bag of frozen peas and some frozen corn.

I tossed raw shrimp with some salt, pepper, and thyme, and a little garlic salt (about 1 tsp of each, 1/4 tsp of the garlic salt).

Then I plopped the sweet potato, the peas, and the corn onto a baking dish, placing the shrimp on top.

Bake at 375ºF for about 20 minutes.
Then I covered with some grated cheddar cheese mixed with sour cream.
