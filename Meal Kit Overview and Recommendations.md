- Marley Spoon (\$15 /serving)

Jamie Oliver's [5 Ingredient Cookbook](``) promotes simple recipes like [lamb kofta flatbread](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/lamb-recipes/lamb-kofta-flatbreads/) (minced lamb, harissa, cabbage, cottage cheese, and tortillas)

Lifehacker has [sugestions for planning ahead](https://lifehacker.com/what-to-do-when-meal-planning-never-seems-to-work-for-y-1789752692) including:

- [CookSmarts](https://www.cooksmarts.com/weekly-meal-plan-service/?_ga=2.233235422.1704404026.1658422452-1376591140.1658422452) will send you a weekly shopping list and recipe instructions.  \$15 / month, though with discounts you can probably get it for half that.   (A review by [this random person](https://jenniferrossrd.wordpress.com/2015/02/26/cooksmarts-a-review/) likes it for teaching her to plan ahead, says nothing took more than an hour to create, but notes that she didn't like some of the meals)
