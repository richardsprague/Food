# Sourdough Focaccia

***
Next time: sprinkle a *lot* more salt on top before baking. Consider adding salt to the dough as well (or will that prevent it from rising?)

Also, bake for no more than 15 minutes. Check it regularly after 10 minutes to ensure it hasn't gone too crispy.

Place a half fist-sized lump of the sourdough into a large bowl, mixing with a cup or two of water until it turns into a smooth, watery liquid.

Add a few cups of flour, kneading it until you get a thick ball of dough. Dribble some olive oil over the top and cover with a towel. 

Set and forget for something like 12 hours. Overnight is fine.

After it has risen into a puffy big ball, spread the whole thing onto a baking dish. Let that rise again too.

Finally, dribble more olive oil and add flavorings like rosemary and flaky salt.

Bake at 450ÂºF for about 15 minutes.
