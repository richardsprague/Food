    "text": "Chorizo is a highly seasoned pork sausage that features prominently in Spanish and Portuguese cuisines. Its defining ingredients are pork, garlic, paprika, and salt.\nThere are many varieties of chorizo depending on the regional traditions. Spanish chorizo can be classified as sweet or spicy. Mexican chorizo differs in that it is raw, rather than cured. It must be cooked before eating. It also incorporates vinegar and chili peppers for a kick of heat and acidity. Mexican chorizo is crumbled and used as a taco filling or meat sauce ingredient.\nChorizo can be eaten sliced on its own, but is often used to add flavor to stews, rice dishes, omelets, pizza, sandwiches and more. Its bold paprika-infused flavor pairs especially well with eggs, beans, potatoes and tomatoes. Both whole links and diced chorizo add a smoky, spicy punch to a variety of dishes."

HelloFresh is one such service that has emerged as a popular option, delivering pre-portioned ingredients and easy-to-follow recipes straight to customers’ doorsteps. But are they worth the trouble compared to a simple grocery delivery services like Walmart+? Here is my comparison.\nHelloFresh costs about $75 for a box of 4 meals of 2 servings each. Roughly, each meal is about $15 - $20 for two people. Because many of the recipes contain single-serve items that aren’t typically sold individually, it’s hard to calculate the costs if you purchased the ingredients at the grocery store.\nBut generally speaking, buying it yourself will be dramatically cheaper, especially as you become used to cooking with a variety of ingredients and learn to creatively reuse excess ingredients originally needed for previous meals."

    "text": "Minestrone is a hearty Italian soup traditionally made with vegetables, often with the addition of pasta or rice. It is a versatile dish that can be adapted to suit seasonal vegetables and personal preferences. The soup is known for its robust flavor, often enhanced with a variety of herbs and spices.\n\nIngredients\nEssential:\n\n1 medium onion, chopped\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n2 carrots, chopped\n1 potato, peeled and cubed\n3 cups tomato sauce\n5 cups vegetable or chicken broth\n1 can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nOptional but Recommended:\n\n4 strips of bacon, diced\n1 cup pre-cooked barley\nOlive oil for sautéing\nFresh basil and/or oregano for garnish\nParmesan cheese for serving\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nSauté Bacon: Turn the Instant Pot to the sauté setting. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and the diced bacon. Cook until the bacon starts to crisp.\nSauté Vegetables: Add the chopped onion, carrots, and garlic. Continue to sauté until the onions become translucent and the carrots begin to soften.\nAdd Potato: Incorporate the cubed potato and stir for a couple of minutes.\nAdd Liquids: Pour in the tomato sauce and vegetable or chicken broth. Stir well to combine.\nPressure Cook: Seal the Instant Pot lid and set it to Manual or Pressure Cook on High for 7 minutes. This will allow the potato and other vegetables to cook through.\nQuick Release: Once the cooking time is up, perform a quick release to depressurize the Instant Pot.\nAdd Beans and Barley: Stir in the cannellini beans and pre-cooked barley. Since these are already cooked, they just need to be heated through.\nHeat Through: Turn the Instant Pot back to the sauté setting and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat the beans and barley.\nSeason and Garnish: Add salt and pepper to taste. You can also add some chopped fresh basil or oregano at this point.\nServe: Ladle the soup into bowls and top with grated Parmesan cheese.\n\n\n\nCooking Notes:\n\nThe Instant Pot significantly reduces the cooking time, especially for the potatoes.\nSince the barley is pre-cooked, it’s added at the end to avoid becoming mushy.\n\nvia ChatGPT\n\n\n\nMinestrone soup with barley",

    "text": "Cumin Club Indian Meal Kits\nNow that we’re empty-nesters, we’ve been trying to stretch our culinary skills by learning to cook beyond the comfortable American and Chinese/Japanese that we normally prepare. I had been hoping to find a true meal kit: something with fresh ingredients and step-by-step instructions – HelloFresh or Blue Apron for ethnic food. But there doesn’t appear to be such a thing (if you know of one, let us know!)\nInstead, this week we tried a semi-prepared meal delivery service from a startup called Cumin Club, founded in 2019 by a U-Chicago MBA student. The web site emphasizes their use of fresh ingredients and no preservatives. I’m not sure why that would be the key selling point. Obviously I don’t want funny chemicals in my food – I expect quality and safety is a given – but maybe they have to say this to differentiate themselves from the traditional, competing importers who may push long shelf life and low costs? In general, it looks like the business is aimed at younger Indian ex-pat singles who have a nostalgic favorite food they can’t easily get at home and don’t want to deal with the hassle of shopping or cooking.\nThe web site seems to assume you already know the dishes by name, so there are few details beyond the ingredients and nutrition information. I had to ask their customer support just to learn the weight of each meal. Are these packets basically just curries intended to be poured on rice or flatbread? If it’s for two people, should we order two of the same packet, or are we better off mixing and matching? It wasn’t clear. Not having any idea what to order, we basically picked meals at random.\nThe meals are shipped freeze-dried, in packets that resemble those just-add-water meals you take on camping trips. (Come to think of it, these would make great backpacking fare). This makes the box, which arrived by FedEx a few days after we ordered, unexpectedly light weight. This is not because the portions are skimpy. Adding water, I found, turns each packet into a half-pound of food, which when eaten with rice or the included bag of 20 fresh roti (“Indian tortillas”), is an ample meal.\nOur first two meals, Kambu Poha and Palak Paneer, were quite tasty."

    "text": "Kakuni is a Japanese-inspired dish that normally requires several hours to prepare. This Instant Pot version can be on the table 75 minutes after you start.\n\nCook Time 50 mins\n\nIngredients\n\n3 green onions/scallions (use only the green parts)1 inch ginger\n1 Tbsp neutral flavor oil (vegetable, canola, etc)\n2 lb pork belly block (2 lb = 907 g)\nWater (for cooking pork belly)\n4 boiled eggs\nTogarashi (Japanese seven spice) (for taste, optional)\n\nSeasonings - 1⁄4 cup sake (1⁄4 cup = 60 ml) - 1⁄2 cup water (1⁄2 cup = 120 ml) - 1⁄2 cup mirin (1⁄2 cup = 120 ml) - 1⁄2 cup soy sauce (1⁄2 cup = 120 ml) - 1⁄4 cup granulated sugar (1⁄4 cup = 50 g)\n\n\nInstructions\n\nWe will only use the green parts of the green onions (use the white parts in miso soup to go with this dish).\nCut the green parts in half. Peel the ginger and slice it thinly.\nPress the “Sauté” button on your Instant Pot and heat the oil. Cook the pork belly.\nYou can skip this part to cut down the cooking time, but this process will render more fat and make the dish tastier.\nPour water to cover the meat, then add the green onions and sliced ginger. Cover and lock the lid.\nPress the “meat/Stew” button to switch to the pressure cooking mode. Cook under pressure for 35 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nporkBellyCooking.jpg\n\n\nWhen it is finished cooking, unlock the lid and drain the cooking water and discard the greenonion and ginger. Rinse the pork belly under warm water.\n\nPut the pork belly back in the Instant Pot and add water, sake, mirin, soy sauce, and sugar. Mix and add the boiled eggs. Press the “Sauté” button on the Instant Pot and press “Adjust”once to increase the heat. Bring it to simmer to let the alcohol evaporate. Once the alcohol smell is gone, press “Keep Warm/Cancel” button to turn off the Sauté mode. Cover and lock the lid. Make sure the steamrelease handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. Press the “meat/Stew” button to turn on the pressurecooking mode. Press the “minus” button to decrease the cooking time from the preset 35 minutes to 10minutes.\nWhen it is finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to a “Keep Warm” mode. Slide the steam release handle to the “Venting” position to let out steam until the float valve drops down and unlock the lid. Ifyou have time (this is optional), press the “Sauté” button and simmer on low heat until the liquid in the cookerhas reduced by half.\nServe the rice in a (donburi) bowl and pour the sauce on top. Place the pork belly and egg (add blanchedgreen vegetable if you have any). Pour additional sauce over the meat and serve immediately. If you like it abit spicy, sprinkle shichimi toagarashi (Japanese seven spice).\n\n\nPressure Cooker Pork Belly (Kakuni) 角煮 (圧力鍋) via Just One Cookbook http://www.justonecookbook.com/pressure-cooker-pork-belly-kakuni/) 1/2 8/6/2017 Pressure Cooker Pork Belly (Kakuni) 角煮 (圧力鍋) • http://www.justonecookbook.com/pressure-cooker-pork-belly-kakuni/ 2/2\n\nExperience 2020-12-14 normal\nboil the eggs while waiting for the first 35-min cycle to complete, and then you can let them cool and peel before the second cycle.\n\n4/22/2019\nWith daikon, mushrooms, and some gobou (add to the final 10-minute cooking session)… still tasted reasonable.\nUse the 35 min initial cycle to boil and cool the eggs, and add liquid to dried mushrooms.\nMore spice or richer flavor would help.  Maybe use togoroshi?\n\n11/16/2018\nI added a few tablespoons of cumin while sauteing the meat. [ no noticeable difference]\nCostco pork belly was $21 for ~5.3 pounds, of which I used half.\n\n10/22/2018: in step “pour water to cover the meat”, I only poured 1/2 cup….not nearly enough to cover it.  The meat turned out chewy.\nI used 1.37 lbs of pre-cubed pork belly from Uwajimaya $7.50\n\n9/28/2018 Start at 5:30, in the table at 6:45 Try mushrooms\n2/15/2018:\nIn the kitchen at 4:47, the Instant Pot countdown started at 5:15.  We were sitting down to eat at 6:15.\nSurprisingly tasty and quick.\n\nMade it on 8/6 started at 5:37 It was on the table at 7:07\nNo sake, so I substituted white cooking wine which was okay, but i think sake would have made it more japanese-flavor.\nThe secret is that last 10 minutes of cooking after you pressure cook the pork.\n\n\n\nPork belly kakuni final dish",
