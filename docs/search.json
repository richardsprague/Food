Peel the ginger and slice it thinly.\nPress the “Sauté” button on your Instant Pot and heat the oil. Cook the pork belly.\nYou can skip this part to cut down the cooking time, but this process will render more fat and make the dish tastier.\nPour water to cover the meat, then add the green onions and sliced ginger.

Press the “Sauté” button on the Instant Pot and press “Adjust”once to increase the heat. Bring it to simmer to let the alcohol evaporate. Once the alcohol smell is gone, press “Keep Warm/Cancel” button to turn off the Sauté mode. Cover and lock the lid. Make sure the steamrelease handle points at “sealing” and not “venting”. Press the “meat/Stew” button to turn on the pressurecooking mode. Press the “minus” button to decrease the cooking time from the preset 35 minutes to 10minutes.\nWhen it is finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to a “Keep Warm” mode. Slide the steam release handle to the “Venting” position to let out steam until the float valve drops down and unlock the lid. Ifyou have time (this is optional), press the “Sauté” button and simmer on low heat until the liquid in the cookerhas reduced by half.\nServe the rice in a (donburi) bowl and pour the sauce on top.

[ no noticeable difference]\nCostco pork belly was $21 for ~5.3 pounds, of which I used half.\n\n10/22/2018: in step “pour water to cover the meat”, I only poured 1/2 cup….not nearly enough to cover it.  The meat turned out chewy.\nI used 1.37 lbs of pre-cubed pork belly from Uwajimaya $7.50\n\n9/28/2018 Start at 5:30, in the table at 6:45 Try mushrooms\n2/15/2018:\nIn the kitchen at 4:47, the Instant Pot countdown started at 5:15.  We were sitting down to eat at 6:15.\nSurprisingly tasty and quick.\n\nMade it on 8/6 started at 5:37 It was on the table at 7:07\nNo sake, so I substituted white cooking wine which was okay, but i think sake would have made it more japanese-flavor.\nThe secret is that last 10 minutes of cooking after you pressure cook the pork.",

HelloFresh is one such service that has emerged as a popular option, delivering pre-portioned ingredients and easy-to-follow recipes straight to customers’ doorsteps. But are they worth the trouble compared to a simple grocery delivery services like Walmart+? Here is my comparison.\nHelloFresh costs about $75 for a box of 4 meals of 2 servings each. Roughly, each meal is about $15 - $20 for two people. Because many of the recipes contain single-serve items that aren’t typically sold individually, it’s hard to calculate the costs if you purchased the ingredients at the grocery store.\nBut generally speaking, buying it yourself will be dramatically cheaper, especially as you become used to cooking with a variety of ingredients and learn to creatively reuse excess ingredients originally needed for previous meals."

    "text": "via ChatGPT\nCreating a Green Bean Casserole with a Chinese twist is an exciting fusion concept that can blend the comfort of a classic American dish with the rich, umami flavors of Chinese cuisine. Below is a detailed recipe that incorporates Chinese elements into the traditional green bean casserole. Given your well-stocked kitchen and culinary skills, you should find this recipe both accessible and ripe for personalization.\n2023-10-23 7:00 PM\nYou can certainly adapt the Green Bean Casserole with a Chinese twist using the ingredients you have on hand. Canned mushrooms can serve as a substitute for shiitake mushrooms, and the condensed French onion soup can add both flavor and moisture to the dish. Here’s how to modify the recipe:\n\nModified Ingredients\n\nFor the Green Beans\n\n1 lb green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces\nSalt, for blanching\n\n\n\nFor the Mushroom-Onion Sauce\n\n1 can of mushrooms, drained\n1 can of condensed French onion soup\n1 tablespoon soy sauce\n1 tablespoon oyster sauce\n1-inch piece of ginger, minced\n2 tablespoons cornstarch, mixed with 2 tablespoons water (optional, for thickening)\n1 tablespoon sesame oil\n\n\n\nFor the Topping\n\n1 cup panko breadcrumbs\n2 tablespoons melted butter\n1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder\n\n\n\nOptional\n\n1 teaspoon Szechuan peppercorns, ground (for added heat and complexity)\n\n\n\n\nModified Instructions\n\nPreheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\nBlanch Green Beans: Boil a pot of salted water and blanch the green beans for 3-4 minutes until they are bright green but still crisp. Drain and set aside.\nPrepare Mushroom-Onion Sauce:\n\nHeat sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat.\nAdd minced ginger and sauté until fragrant.\nAdd the drained canned mushrooms and sauté for a couple of minutes.\nStir in the can of condensed French onion soup, soy sauce, and oyster sauce.\nIf you prefer a thicker sauce, add the cornstarch-water mixture and stir until the sauce thickens.\n\nCombine and Layer:\n\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the blanched green beans and mushroom-onion sauce.\nTransfer the mixture to a casserole dish, spreading it out evenly.\n\nPrepare Topping:\n\nIn a separate bowl, mix panko breadcrumbs with melted butter and Chinese five-spice powder. Optionally, add ground Szechuan peppercorns for extra kick.\nSprinkle this mixture evenly over the green beans in the casserole dish.\n\nBake:\n\nPlace the casserole dish in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling.\n\nServe: Allow the casserole to cool for a few minutes before serving.\n\n\n\nCustomization Tips\n\nSpices: If you have star anise or fennel seeds, consider adding them to the sauce for added complexity.\nTexture: Given that canned mushrooms are generally softer than fresh ones, you might consider adding other textural elements like water chestnuts or bamboo shoots if you have them.\n\nThis adapted recipe should allow you to create a fusion Green Bean Casserole with the ingredients you have, while still incorporating Chinese flavors. Enjoy your cooking!"

Its defining ingredients are pork, garlic, paprika, and salt.\nThere are many varieties of chorizo depending on the regional traditions. Spanish chorizo can be classified as sweet or spicy. Mexican chorizo differs in that it is raw, rather than cured. It must be cooked before eating. It also incorporates vinegar and chili peppers for a kick of heat and acidity. Mexican chorizo is crumbled and used as a taco filling or meat sauce ingredient.\nChorizo can be eaten sliced on its own, but is often used to add flavor to stews, rice dishes, omelets, pizza, sandwiches and more. Its bold paprika-infused flavor pairs especially well with eggs, beans, potatoes and tomatoes. Both whole links and diced chorizo add a smoky, spicy punch to a variety of dishes."

I grilled the tofu instead of pan-sauteing them, which probably kept them more bland than they should have.\n\nIngredients\n\n400g firm tofu\n200g chorizo, finely chopped\n400g fettuccine pasta\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n1 large onion, finely chopped\n1/2 cup dry white wine\n1/2 cup chicken broth (or vegetable broth)\nSalt and pepper to taste\nFresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n\n\nInstructions\nStart by pressing the tofu to remove excess moisture. Cut it into small cubes.\nIn a non-stick pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once hot, add the tofu cubes. Stir frequently until all sides are crispy and golden brown. Once done, set them aside.\nIn the same pan, add the chorizo and cook until fully cooked and slightly crispy. Once done, set it aside with the tofu.\nCook the fettuccine according to the package instructions in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain, reserving some pasta water.\nIn the same non-stick pan, add another tablespoon of olive oil and sauté the garlic and onion until the onion becomes translucent.\nDeglaze the pan with the dry white wine, allowing it to simmer and reduce by half.\nAdd the chicken broth and let it simmer for a couple of minutes. If needed, you can add some of the reserved pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency.\nAdd the cooked fettuccine, crispy tofu, and chorizo back into the pan. Stir everything together, ensuring the pasta is well coated with the sauce.\nSeason with salt and pepper to taste.\nBefore serving, sprinkle freshly chopped parsley over the pasta for an added touch of freshness and color.\nThis dish provides a harmonious blend of flavors - the spiciness of the chorizo is balanced by the crisp tofu, and the pasta ties it all together. Enjoy your meal!\n\n\n\nChorizo Tofu Fusion"

    "text": "Cumin Club Indian Meal Kits\nNow that we’re empty-nesters, we’ve been trying to stretch our culinary skills by learning to cook beyond the comfortable American and Chinese/Japanese that we normally prepare. I had been hoping to find a true meal kit: something with fresh ingredients and step-by-step instructions – HelloFresh or Blue Apron for ethnic food. But there doesn’t appear to be such a thing (if you know of one, let us know!)\nInstead, this week we tried a semi-prepared meal delivery service from a startup called Cumin Club, founded in 2019 by a U-Chicago MBA student. The web site emphasizes their use of fresh ingredients and no preservatives. I’m not sure why that would be the key selling point. Obviously I don’t want funny chemicals in my food – I expect quality and safety is a given – but maybe they have to say this to differentiate themselves from the traditional, competing importers who may push long shelf life and low costs? In general, it looks like the business is aimed at younger Indian ex-pat singles who have a nostalgic favorite food they can’t easily get at home and don’t want to deal with the hassle of shopping or cooking.\nThe web site seems to assume you already know the dishes by name, so there are few details beyond the ingredients and nutrition information. I had to ask their customer support just to learn the weight of each meal. Are these packets basically just curries intended to be poured on rice or flatbread? If it’s for two people, should we order two of the same packet, or are we better off mixing and matching? It wasn’t clear. Not having any idea what to order, we basically picked meals at random.\nThe meals are shipped freeze-dried, in packets that resemble those just-add-water meals you take on camping trips. (Come to think of it, these would make great backpacking fare). This makes the box, which arrived by FedEx a few days after we ordered, unexpectedly light weight. This is not because the portions are skimpy. Adding water, I found, turns each packet into a half-pound of food, which when eaten with rice or the included bag of 20 fresh roti (“Indian tortillas”), is an ample meal.\nOur first two meals, Kambu Poha and Palak Paneer, were quite tasty."

    "text": "Method\n\nMarinate the salmon: In a small bowl, whisk together harissa, ras el hanout, cumin, tajine mix, olive oil, and lemon juice. Season salmon fillets with salt, then coat with marinade. Let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, up to 2 hours.\nHeat the oven to 400 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\nPrepare the broccoli: Toss broccoli florets with olive oil, cumin, and salt. Spread on one prepared baking sheet. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, until edges are crispy and stems are tender.\nMake the couscous: While broccoli roasts, heat olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add couscous and toast, stirring frequently, until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in couscous spice mix, then carefully add hot broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until tender and liquid is absorbed, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.\nCook the salmon: About 15 minutes before serving, place marinated salmon skin-side down on second prepared baking sheet. Mix panko with a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle over salmon. Roast for 7 to 8 minutes. Scatter torn prosciutto pieces over salmon and continue cooking until fish flakes easily and internal temperature reaches 125 to 130 degrees, 3 to 4 minutes more.\nFinish and serve: Remove broccoli from oven and immediately sprinkle with crumbled cheese. Spread couscous on serving plates, top with salmon, and arrange broccoli alongside. Garnish with rose petals and serve with lemon wedges."

If using regular couscous, reduce liquid and cooking time according to package directions.\nThe spice blend can be adjusted to taste—start conservatively with the tajine mix as some blends are quite potent.\nScoring the salmon skin lightly with a knife prevents curling during cooking.\nFor a dairy-free version, omit the cheese or substitute with toasted pine nuts."

    "text": "Appendix: Cook’s Experience Notes\nJune 17, 2025\n12:00 PM: Began marinating salmon with custom spice blend using Christmas gift spice collection from Mondspice. Used approximately 1 hour marination time.\n6:00 PM: Preheated oven to 400°F. Started broccoli prep and got it into oven first for 25-minute roast time. Simultaneously began pearl couscous preparation—toasting method worked excellently for developing nutty flavor base.\n6:15 PM: Added salmon to oven with panko crust as planned. Timing coordination between multiple dishes proved manageable with staggered start times.\n6:22 PM: Added torn prosciutto pieces to salmon for final crisping phase.\n6:30 PM: All components finished simultaneously. The rose petal garnish from the spice collection added an unexpected but successful floral note that complemented the ras el hanout.\nPost-meal notes: The layered approach with prosciutto over panko worked perfectly—no burning issues. The couscous spice mix was more potent than expected; next time might reduce to ¾ teaspoon. Skin-on salmon roasted beautifully without any kitchen odor concerns. Overall timing strategy successful for weeknight execution.\nSubstitution considerations for future: Could easily adapt for guests by scaling up. The marinade would work equally well with chicken thighs or lamb. Vegetarian version possible using the spiced couscous as base with roasted vegetables and omitting the fish/prosciutto elements."

Cover them with about 1 inch of water. Close the lid, set the vent to “Sealing,” and cook on high pressure (Manual mode) for about 6-8 minutes. Let the pressure naturally release for about 10-15 minutes, then quick release any remaining pressure.\nWhile the beans are cooking, prepare the rice according to the package instructions. Add a bit of cumin and a clove of garlic to the water for added flavor.\nSlice the Andouille sausage into small chunks or thin slices. Sauté it in a skillet over medium heat until it’s nicely browned and cooked through.\nOnce the beans are cooked and the pressure is released, drain the beans and set them aside. Add the drained beans to the skillet with the cooked sausage. Add the canned diced tomato, drained canned mushrooms, and some canned jalapeno (according to your heat preference).\nSlice the zucchini into small chunks or thin slices and add it to the skillet. Sauté everything together until the vegetables are tender and it’s all warmed through. Season with your chosen spices to taste.\nPreheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).\nLay a tortilla flat and spread a layer of rice down the middle. Top it with the sausage, bean, and vegetable mixture, and then sprinkle a generous amount of Mexican cheese on top. Roll it up and place it seam-side down in a baking dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling.\nOnce all your enchiladas are in the baking dish, pour the enchilada sauce evenly over the top. If you have any remaining filling, you can sprinkle it over the top as well, followed by another layer of cheese.\nCover the baking dish with foil and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the sauce is bubbling.\nAfter the initial baking, you can remove the foil and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.\nLet the casserole rest for a few minutes before serving. You can garnish it with fresh tomato and a drizzle of Oaxacan mole sauce , if desired."

    "text": "Minestrone is a hearty Italian soup traditionally made with vegetables, often with the addition of pasta or rice. It is a versatile dish that can be adapted to suit seasonal vegetables and personal preferences. The soup is known for its robust flavor, often enhanced with a variety of herbs and spices.\n\nIngredients\nEssential:\n\n1 medium onion, chopped\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n2 carrots, chopped\n1 potato, peeled and cubed\n3 cups tomato sauce\n5 cups vegetable or chicken broth\n1 can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nOptional but Recommended:\n\n4 strips of bacon, diced\n1 cup pre-cooked barley\nOlive oil for sautéing\nFresh basil and/or oregano for garnish\nParmesan cheese for serving\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nSauté Bacon: Turn the Instant Pot to the sauté setting. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and the diced bacon. Cook until the bacon starts to crisp.\nSauté Vegetables: Add the chopped onion, carrots, and garlic. Continue to sauté until the onions become translucent and the carrots begin to soften.\nAdd Potato: Incorporate the cubed potato and stir for a couple of minutes.\nAdd Liquids: Pour in the tomato sauce and vegetable or chicken broth. Stir well to combine.\nPressure Cook: Seal the Instant Pot lid and set it to Manual or Pressure Cook on High for 7 minutes. This will allow the potato and other vegetables to cook through.\nQuick Release: Once the cooking time is up, perform a quick release to depressurize the Instant Pot.\nAdd Beans and Barley: Stir in the cannellini beans and pre-cooked barley. Since these are already cooked, they just need to be heated through.\nHeat Through: Turn the Instant Pot back to the sauté setting and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat the beans and barley.\nSeason and Garnish: Add salt and pepper to taste. You can also add some chopped fresh basil or oregano at this point.\nServe: Ladle the soup into bowls and top with grated Parmesan cheese.\n\n\n\nCooking Notes:\n\nThe Instant Pot significantly reduces the cooking time, especially for the potatoes.\nSince the barley is pre-cooked, it’s added at the end to avoid becoming mushy.\n\nvia ChatGPT\n\n\n\nMinestrone soup with barley",

Place the dough inside the oven for an hour or two to let it start to rise. Then put it on the kitchen counter until about 4pm, by which time it had risen enough to spill over the top of the bowl. Refrigerate overnight.\n2021-01-11 breadmaker 2 Started at 7:30, this time with everything in the machine from the start.\nI had to add more than a full cup of additional flour to the machine (maybe 100g) to keep the mixture doughy enough. Even that wasn’t enough. Next time dry less water.\n2021-01-14 Half Loaf\nCut all ingredients in half to make a smaller loaf. Started rising by 8am.

Don’t go too deep – no point getting rid of the good mushroom flesh. Also, might as well keep the stem on as well.\nMarinate for at least an hour\nRemove the mushrooms from the marinade and place them in a 400ºF oven for about 15 minutes to soften.\nWhile waiting for the mushrooms, start sautéing the onion and garlic and mix together the stuffing.\nRemove the mushrooms from the oven and stuff them to the gills.\nPlace back in the oven for another 15 minutes or so."
