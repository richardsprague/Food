## Ingredients 

- 1 lb ground Italian sausage
- 2 tablespoons cooking oil (preferably Sichuan oil if you have)
- 1 tablespoon Mexican oregano
- 1 tablespoon Chinese black vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon harissa
- A pinch of cardamom
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 medium-sized onion, sliced
- 2 medium carrots, sliced into thin rounds
- 1 lb green beans, trimmed
- 2 tablespoons Lao Gan Ma Spicy Chili Crisp (adjust to your preference)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- A pinch of dried Sichuan peppercorns, crushed
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. in a large wok or skillet, heat the cooking oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onion, sliced carrots, and green beans. Cook until they start to soften, about 7-10 minutes.
3. Add the minced garlic, cook for another minute until fragrant, then add the ground cumin, harissa, a pinch of cardamom, Mexican oregano, and crushed Sichuan peppercorns. Stir well to combine all the flavors.
5. Push the vegetables to the sides of the wok or skillet, making a space in the center. Add the ground Italian sausage to this space, breaking it up into smaller chunks with your spatula. Cook until it's browned and no longer pink, about 5-7 minutes, then mix it with the vegetables.
7. Add the Lao Gan Ma Spicy Chili Crisp, pour in the soy sauce and black vinegar, stir well, and let everything cook for another 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper if needed.
9. Turn off the heat, sprinkle the chopped cilantro over the stir-fry and give it a final mix.
11. Serve the Oaxacan-Yunnan Italian Sausage Stir-fry over a bed of brown rice.
