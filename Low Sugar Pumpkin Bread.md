title: Low Sugar Pumpkin Bread
---

A classic autumn staple, pumpkin bread is a great way to use up those extra cans of pumpkin puree you find in your cupboard from when you bought them last year at a deep discount after Halloween.


### Ingredients

#### Dry Ingredients:

- 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon allspice

#### Wet Ingredients:

- 1/4 cup sugar (reduced from the original 1/2 cup)
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 2 large eggs
- 1/3 cup water
- 1 can (15 oz) pumpkin puree (like the one you have)

#### Optional Add-Ins:

- 1/2 cup walnuts or pecans
- 1/2 cup unsweetened dried fruits (e.g., raisins, cranberries)

### Instructions

1.  **Preparation:**
    
    - Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
    - Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
2.  **Dry Ingredients:**
    
    - In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients.
3.  **Wet Ingredients:**
    
    - In another bowl, mix the sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, and water.
    - Stir in the pumpkin puree.
4.  **Combine:**
    
    - Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Mix until just combined.
5.  **Optional Add-Ins:**
    
    - Fold in the nuts or dried fruits, if desired.
6.  **Bake:**
    
    - Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
    - Bake for 60-65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
7.  **Cool:**
    
    - Let the bread cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

#### Tips:

- **Natural Sweeteners:** You can replace the sugar with natural sweeteners like mashed bananas, applesauce, or pureed dates for added sweetness without refined sugar.
    
- **Spice Modification:** Given your interest in unique flavors, try using Mexican canela or Chinese five-spice for a different taste profile.
    
- **Texture:** The reduced sugar content might make the bread slightly denser, but the natural moisture from the pumpkin should keep it relatively tender.
    

Remember, the key to reducing sugar in recipes is balancing the flavors so that the dish remains enjoyable. Experiment with various natural sweeteners and spices to find the perfect combination for your palate.
