This time I threw the packets right into the sous vide at 130ºF for 30 minutes. It came out perfectly soft. Because I used the cast iron skillet for something else, I opted to broil it for about 4-5 minutes but it didn't do much.

## Insights
Swordfish is tough and chewy, especially when cooked too long. Consider doing sous vide next time.

Orzo is surprisingly easy in a pan like this. Dump tomatoes and some chicken broth and it will boil down easily.

There might be room next time for something involving cheese.

## Ingredients
- ~1 lb swordfish, cut into 2 portions
- 1 cup orzo
- 1 15 oz can diced tomatoes
- 1/4 cup fish or chicken stock (more if needed)
- 1 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 1 tsp paprika
- Salt & pepper


## Instructions

1. Sear the spice-rubbed swordfish for a few minutes each side. Remove
2. Drop a cup of orzo onto the pan and lightly toast
3. add a can of diced tomatoes, plus 1 TBS of Italian seasoning and 1/4 cup of chicken broth.
4. Add back the swordfish
