## Swordfish

Sam's Choice frozen [Swordfish Steaks](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sam-s-Choice-Frozen-All-Natural-Wild-Caught-Swordfish-Steaks-Skin-on-Fillets-12-oz/116083626?athbdg=L1100&from=/search) 
130ºF for 30 minutes is okay, but comes out a little chewy.

Marinated with some fresh ginger, soy sauce.

After running for 120ºF for an hour, I seared it briefly and then cut it into cubes to make fish tacos. Serve with shredded cabbage and some pinto beans.
