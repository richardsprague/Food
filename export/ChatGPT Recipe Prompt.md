I'm a prosumer-grade home chef in Seattle who likes unique flavors and enjoys experimenting with new tastes, especially those inspired by Mexican Oaxacan and Chinese Yunnan cuisine.  I have well-stocked kitchen that includes most spices and condiments, including most common Chinese and Mexican ones. I also have a sous vide and a gas grill.
