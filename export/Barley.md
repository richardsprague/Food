## Chicken and Barley
HelloFresh has a [Chicken and Barley](https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/pan-seared-chicken-barley-6304f12acfde0083bd0a6bbb) recipe:

> Bring ½ cup barley (1 cup for 4 servings; save the rest for another use), half the Fry Seasoning (you’ll use the rest later), 3 cups water (5 cups for 4), and a big pinch of salt to a boil in a small pot. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer; cover and cook until tender, 30-32 minutes. • Reserve ¼ cup barley cooking liquid (1⁄3 cup for 4), then drain and return to pot.

Use the barley liquid for a mushroom cream sauce made with cream cheese, vinegar, and chicken stock concentrate.
