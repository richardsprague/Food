# Sous Vide: Tuna

same thing, oniy without sous vide. After an hour marinating, I put it in the oven at 450ºF for about 2-3 minutes each side, flipping in the middle. Then another 2-3 minutes blasting with the broiler, checking the temperature with my thermometer. Internal temp of a little over 120.

Marinate with miso (3), soy sauce (1), mirin (2) plus some ginger and cook at 115ºF for 45 minutes. 

Next time consider a quick sauté *before* marinating.

Serve with broccoli and a cream sauce made of:
