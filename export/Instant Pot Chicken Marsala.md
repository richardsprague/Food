Instant Pot: 2023-02-06
Start at 5:15, ready by 6pm. Remember to tone down the liquids. I used half a can of chicken broth and that was too much.

works great. Start at 5:15 and it's ready by 6.

The version without Instant Pot is good and easy too.  See [Once Upon a Chef](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/chicken-marsala.html#tabrecipe)

2022-11-21 I tried making it with sous vide chicken:
1. brown the chicken and set aside
2. saut√© the mushrooms with butter. Add garlic and shallot
3. Add marsala wine, chicken broth and let it boil down for ~10 min
4. Add a little flour to thicken if necessary

Then I added some fettuccine noodles, but I think that was too much. Next time keep the noodles on the side.

## Insights
Use a minimal amount of liquids.  1/2 cup of chicken broth was about right; you might even get by with a little less.

Taste as you go.  I needed more salt and pepper.  Next time consider other spices too (e.g. poultry seasoning?)


## Ingredients
- Chicken thighs (bone in)
- Mushrooms
- 1/2 cup Chicken broth
- Green onion
- Garlic
- 1/3 cup marsala cooking wine
- 1/3 cup heavy cream

## Directions

1. Cover the chicken with salt, pepper and a light coating of flour.
2. Saute the chicken for a couple minutes each side, until it looks reasonably brown. Remove it.
3. Add the mushrooms/onions/garlic and saute for a few minutes.
4. Add chicken broth and return the chicken
5. Set Manual-High Pressure for 10 minutes.  Let it continue for another 12 minutes after it beeps. Remove the chicken.
6. Add the marsala wine, cook for a few minutes. Add the cream and cook for a few minutes more.
