inspired by [Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/40-minute-hamburger-buns/)


## Ingredients

- Yeast: one spoonful
- Avocado oil: several spoonfuls
- Sugar: several spoonfuls
- Salt: a teaspoon or two
- Egg: 1 small
- Water: half cup from a hot faucet
- Flour: should be 3-3.5x the amount of water

## Directions

1. Add the yeast and oil to the water and leave set for 5 minutes.
2. Mix everything into a dough ball and keep kneading for 5 minutes
3. Divide into pieces and shape out round balls to size your buns
4. Let it rest for 10 minutes, not longer. You don't want it to rise much.
5. Shake some sesame seeds on top and bake at 350ÂºF for 10 minutes or so

## Issues

Didn't rise. Make sure you put in "several" spoons of yeast.
Also, please don't forget the salt.


2022-07-24  turned out "cakey"

I threw the ingredients together without measuring, though I was careful to begin with 1/4 cup water. Somehow the concoction was too wet, which I alleviated with extra flour but I think that threw off the ratios somehow. Next time follow the original measures more carefully.
