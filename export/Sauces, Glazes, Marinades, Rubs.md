## Sauces

Spike with spices a dressing (especially blue cheese) mixed with a little sour cream. Maybe add some water and mix to make a drizzle you can apply to various dishes.

### Cream Sauce

Inspired by [Food.com](https://www.food.com/recipe/olive-garden-herb-parmesan-cream-sauce-245673)

I used 
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese
- dried basil
- 2-3 tablespoons of cream cheese

1. Put the cream into the saucepan and let it come to almost boil.
2. Add the parmesan cheese mixed with basil and let it all melt
3. Add thickness by adding cream cheese


**Variation: Sour Cream**
e.g. sauté some minced onions and add chicken stock concentrate and water. Then creamy caesar dressing. 

minced shallot with 4 TBS of white wine vinegar makes a tangy sauce. Add 1 tsp sugar and 1/4 cup water. Let it boil off, remove from heat and add 4 TBS sour cream and 1 TBS butter.



**Mushroom sauce:**
sauté some chopped mushrooms and remove from pan.
drop 2 TBS cream cheese, 3 TBS white wine vinegar, chicken stock concentrate with water, garlic powder.

**Miso cream**

* finely-chopped onion or shallots with garlic
* 1 TBS miso, a splash of soy sauce
* Cream and butter





## Glaze


**Honey, Yuzu Kosho, and vinegar**
spread sour cream on chicken or fish and pat the tops with Bread crumbs (panko) mixed with melted butter and a hot spice. Bake in the oven.

**Jam (Apricot), chicken broth concentrate**
Add water and then let it boil off while sautéing something like meatballs.

## Marinades and Mops

### General Tips

Chinese black vinegar and soy sauce makes a nice rich umami flavor. Spread on vegetables and roast.

This is a tasty one suggested by ChatGPT.  I spread it on chicken while grilling.
