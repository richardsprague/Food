A tasty bread that won't raise your glucose levels.  Good as a base for spreading cheese or avocado.


## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups almond flour
- 1/4 cup flaxseed
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 5 eggs
- 1 TBS apple cider vinegar
- 1 TBS olive oil
- Sesame seeds


## Instructions

I beat the egg whites, then added all the wet ingredients.  Mix the dry ingredients and add to the wet bowl.

Bake at 350ºF covered with tinfoil for at least 40 minutes. Supposedly you need to check that the top doesn't burn, but I found that it took longer to bake than expected.

A pretty reasonable substitute for bread, as a base for spreading cheese or avocado for example.

A little messy and time-consuming to make, since it’s tough to mix the thick almond butter. I used the hand mixer, which required regular stops to clean out the viscous mess on the blades, but the final result was reasonably well-mixed.

Next time try to ensure plenty of almond oil in the mixture, or consider adding additional olive or avocado oil to make it smoother.
