I soaked 1 cup of black beans overnight

Chop half an onion and a clove of garlic

Using our big [Le Creuset](https://www.lecreuset.com/cookware) orange dutch oven, I smeared some olive oil, let it heat up, and then crumbled some ground beef and chorizo over the bottom (probably less than a pound total).  After a few minutes I dropped on the onion and garlic and let it soften.

Now dump all the beans, plus a can of diced tomatoes, plus about 2-3 cups of water with beef broth.  Then shake some oregano on top, and a few pepper flakes.

Leave cooking on the stove for about 2 hours, carefully checking to make sure the bottom isn't burning. You might need to add liquid.

Let it sit for half an hour or so.

Serve on brown rice, with avocado and/or sour cream, Mexican cheese.
