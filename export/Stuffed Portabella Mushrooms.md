title: Stuffed Portabella Mushrooms
---

A rich and tasty way to make a light vegetarian meal.

I found these close to their expiration date marked down to to \$2.59

## Ingredients

For 2 large Portabella mushroom caps

sauté some onion and garlic until soft

**Marinade**
- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
- 1/8 cup dark soy sauce
- 1/8 cup light soy sauce
- 1 TBS thyme
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- Olive oil: enough to smother the mushrooms

**Stuffing**
- 1/4 cup bread crumbs
- Chopped spinach leaves (a couple of cups)
- 1/4 cup goat cheese
- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese

## Directions

Scrape out the gills from the mushrooms. I used a short knife, quickly scraped back and forth and then pulled out the shavings with a spoon. Don't go too deep -- no point getting rid of the good mushroom flesh. Also, might as well keep the stem on as well.

Marinate for at least an hour

Remove the mushrooms from the marinade and place them in a 400ºF oven for about 15 minutes to soften.

While waiting for the mushrooms, start sautéing the onion and garlic and mix together the stuffing.

Remove the mushrooms from the oven and stuff them to the gills.

Place back in the oven for another 15 minutes or so.

## Next

Tastes great, but consider adding something else for color, like a tomato-based cream sauce?

## Stuffing
- shallots and elephant garlic, plus chopped mushroom stems
- add sun-dried tomato and a bunch of salt \& pepper
- add a ton of spinach, wait for it to wilt, and chop it up in the pan
- remove from pan and mix with 1/4 cup bread crumbs and goat cheese

## Bake
bake for about 45 minutes at 375ºF and then top with mozzarella cheese and broil for 3-4 minutes to brown the tops.

## What to do with the gills
I removed and discarded the gills, but [many sources](https://www.discusscooking.com/threads/why-de-gill-portabella-mushrooms.81706/) suggest this is unnecessary. If you're worried about the slightly bitter flavor they add, I suppose you can do like I did above: remove and mix with something else with a strong flavor, like sausage.
