Tastes excellent. 
Next time: try adding mushrooms and take out some of the breadcrumbs to lower the glucose-spiking carbs.

## Ingredients

- 1 TBS dry basil (or 1/4 cup chopped fresh, if you have it)
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- ½ cup white wine
- 1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided

## Instructions

1. Saute shrimp, basil and garlic until shrimp turns pink, about 1 minute. Stir in the reserved chopped eggplant. Season with salt and pepper. Pour in wine, and cook 5 minutes.

Transfer to a large bowl, and mix in the bread crumbs and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. If mixture is dry, stir in more olive oil. Stuff mixture into eggplant shells, and sprinkle top with remaining Parmesan cheese.

Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until eggplant is tender.
