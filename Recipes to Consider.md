> Recommendation: Gado gado sauce from Indonesian (and some Malaysian) supermarket. Comes as a small square/rectangular brown block. Might be called gado gado salad dressing, bumbu kacang, sometimes sambel pecel. It's a block of pre-cooked peanut/satay style sauce that you add to some hot water, stir, and serve. Fragrant, hints of lime, good for unexpected vegan guests.
