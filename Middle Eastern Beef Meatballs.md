served with [Tomato Watermelon Salad](Salad.md#tomato-watermelon-salad)

2210 first attempt

## Ingredients

###  Shwarma spice blend
Don't be afraid to mix the entire amount with a pound of ground beef to give it a heavy flavor.  I used half the amount and it wasn't quite enough punch.

[instructions](https://www.mccormick.com/recipes/other/shawarma-spice-blend) for 10 1 tsp servings  
- 2 tablespoons McCormick Gourmet™ Organic Ground Coriander
- 1 teaspoon McCormick® Ground Allspice
- 1 teaspoon McCormick® Ground Cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon McCormick® Ground Cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon McCormick® Ground Ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon McCormick® Ground Turmeric
- 1/4 teaspoon McCormick® Pure Ground Black Pepper

### Lemony hummus
- 4 TBS of hummus mixed with olive oil and lemon juice

## Directions

Knead the spice blend plus some minced onions into about 1 lb of beef. Roll into small balls -- I made nine with 1 lb -- and gently sauté on a fry pan.

I served with some chopped tomato mixed with avocado pieces, plus some wilted spinach, all on top of some brown rice.  Spread the hummus on top.

## Variations

Another option is to use **[Lentils](Lentils.md)** as a filler for ground beef. Lentils are high in protein and fiber and have a similar texture to ground beef when cooked. You can cook 1/4 cup of dry lentils in water for about 20 minutes or until tender, then drain and add them to 1/3 lb of ground beef. Mix well and form into patties or balls as desired. You can cook them as you would normally cook ground beef.

I tried this variation 230424: with regular [ Hummus](Hummus.md). Works well, and in fact may even be preferable to the all-beef kind. Next time: overcook the lentils to make them softer, and consider adding an egg to the beef mixture to make them stick together better.
