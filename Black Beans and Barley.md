### Ingredients
- 1 cup dried black beans
- 1/2 cup pearl barley
- 1 large onion, finely chopped (approximately 1.5 cups)

- 4 cups vegetable or chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons cumin
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon chili powder

2. Add Spices: Add 2 teaspoons cumin, 1 teaspoon paprika, and 1 teaspoon chili powder to the sautéed vegetables. Stir well and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
3. Combine Ingredients: Add the cooked black beans and pearl barley to the pot.
