Chorizo is a highly seasoned pork sausage that features prominently in Spanish and Portuguese cuisines. Its defining ingredients are pork, garlic, paprika, and salt.

There are many varieties of chorizo depending on the regional traditions. Spanish chorizo can be classified as sweet or spicy.  Mexican chorizo differs in that it is raw, rather than cured. It must be cooked before eating. It also incorporates vinegar and chili peppers for a kick of heat and acidity. Mexican chorizo is crumbled and used as a taco filling or meat sauce ingredient.

Chorizo can be eaten sliced on its own, but is often used to add flavor to stews, rice dishes, omelets, pizza, sandwiches and more. Its bold paprika-infused flavor pairs especially well with eggs, beans, potatoes and tomatoes. Both whole links and diced chorizo add a smoky, spicy punch to a variety of dishes.

## Chorizo Tacos

I grilled the mixture on the gas grill outdoors, but it's way too crumbly and easily falls through the grills.

Next time: just make the mixture on the stove.

**Grilled Chorizo-Beef Tacos with Spinach-Tomato Salsa**

### Ingredients:

- 1 lb ground beef
- 1/2 lb chorizo
- 8 corn tortillas
- 2 cups fresh spinach
- 2 medium tomatoes
- 1/2 onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 lime
- Salt, pepper, and optionally, chili flakes

### Instructions
For the grilled Chorizo-Beef:

1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.
2. Mix the ground beef and chorizo together in a bowl until well combined. Divide the mixture into 8 equal parts and shape into sausage-like forms.
3. Grill the chorizo-beef mix, turning occasionally, until browned and cooked through (about 15-20 minutes).
4. Remove the chorizo-beef from the grill and let rest.

For the Spinach-Tomato Salsa:

1. Dice the tomatoes and chop the spinach finely.
2. In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, spinach, onion, and garlic.
3. Squeeze the juice from the lime into the bowl, add salt and pepper (and optionally chili flakes) to taste, and mix well.

For the Tacos:

1. Briefly grill the tortillas until they're warm and slightly charred.
2. Place a grilled chorizo-beef mix in the center of each tortilla.
3. Top each with a generous helping of the spinach-tomato salsa.

## Chorizo \& Tofu Fusion

Not terribly flavorful.  I grilled the tofu instead of pan-sauteing them, which probably kept them more bland than they should have.

### Ingredients

- 400g firm tofu
- 200g chorizo, finely chopped
- 400g fettuccine pasta
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1/2 cup chicken broth (or vegetable broth)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

### Instructions

Start by pressing the tofu to remove excess moisture. Cut it into small cubes.

In a non-stick pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once hot, add the tofu cubes. Stir frequently until all sides are crispy and golden brown. Once done, set them aside.

In the same pan, add the chorizo and cook until fully cooked and slightly crispy. Once done, set it aside with the tofu.

Cook the fettuccine according to the package instructions in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain, reserving some pasta water.

In the same non-stick pan, add another tablespoon of olive oil and sauté the garlic and onion until the onion becomes translucent.

Deglaze the pan with the dry white wine, allowing it to simmer and reduce by half.

Add the chicken broth and let it simmer for a couple of minutes. If needed, you can add some of the reserved pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency.

Add the cooked fettuccine, crispy tofu, and chorizo back into the pan. Stir everything together, ensuring the pasta is well coated with the sauce.

Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Before serving, sprinkle freshly chopped parsley over the pasta for an added touch of freshness and color.

This dish provides a harmonious blend of flavors - the spiciness of the chorizo is balanced by the crisp tofu, and the pasta ties it all together. Enjoy your meal!
