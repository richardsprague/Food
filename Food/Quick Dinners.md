# Quick Dinners

*When you need something good on the table in 30 minutes or less*

## 15-20 Minutes
- [[Honey-garlic shrimp]] - marinade while prepping sides
- [[Pan-Fry Ravioli with tomato cream sauce]] - one pan, minimal prep
- [[Artichoke Orzo]] - dump and simmer
- [[Spam]] - quick sauté over rice

## 25-30 Minutes
- [[Ground turkey skillet]] - one pot meal
- [[Sausage and Couscous]] - hearty and filling
- [[Instant Pot Chicken Marsala]] - hands-off cooking
- [[Tilapia with Miso and Scallions]] - quick marinade + sauté

## Always Have on Hand
- [[Hummus]] - quick protein
- [[Salsa]] - fresh flavors
- [[Eggs]] - sous vide poached or scrambled
- Canned beans - add to anything

## Technique Shortcuts
- [[Sous Vide]] - cook ahead, quick finish
- [[Instant Pot]] - set and forget
- Pre-chopped [[Mirepoix]] - flavor base ready to go

## Emergency Combinations
