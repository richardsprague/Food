title: French Lentils stuffed Poblano
---

This is an easy one: [Easy Stuffed Poblanos](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/easy-stuffed-poblanos/)


***

Use 2.5x liquid.

I used 
- 1 cup of french lentils
- 1 can of beef broth
- 1.5 cups of water

Slice poblano peppers in half, and roast at 350ÂºF for 20+ minutes until they look shriveled.

Bring the lentils to boil, and then set on low heat for about 20-25 minutes. 

Separately, saute some tomato and garlic.  Add to the lentils when you turn off the heat. Mix the tomatoes and let it set for 10 minutes.

Stuff the poblanos with the lentil mixture.
