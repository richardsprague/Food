Chicken Thighs Morocco and Barley

2022-11-14 7:10 PM

I did this recipe from [Silk Road Recipes](https://silkroadrecipes.com/moroccan-spiced-chicken-and-barley/#recipe)

But I substituted a leeks/carrot/celery  [mirepoix](Mirepoix%20Tips.md) for the onion/bell pepper below.

Next time: don't forget the soy sauce

## Ingredients

### Spice Rub
- 2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon dried mint flakes
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon cayenne powder


### Assembly
- 2 lbs chicken thighs boneless and skinless
- 4 tablespoon olive oil divided
- 1 medium yellow onion diced
- 1 red bell pepper diced
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 1¼ cups barley uncooked (See Note 1)
- 14 oz diced tomatoes drained
- 6 green onions chopped

### Instructions

- Brown the chicken and remove
- Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sauté the onion, bell pepper and add the soy sauce. Cook over medium heat for several minutes until onions are translucent.
- Deglaze pan by adding the broth, scraping the browned bits from bottom of pan. Stir in pearled barley, tomatoes and remaining spice mixture. Place the browned chicken thighs in between the vegetable mixture evenly. Bring this to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, cover and cook for 50 minutes.
- Uncover and let stand 15 minutes to completely absorb all liquids. Sprinkle with the green onions and serve.
