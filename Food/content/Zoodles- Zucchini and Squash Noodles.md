## Cream of Mushroom Sauce


### Next Time
Salt the zucchini and let it sit for a *long time*, a couple of hours, to let it dry out as much as possible.

I'm not sure the canned mushroom sauce will pair well with this dish anyway. You may need to use chopped mushrooms and skip the cream.

### Directions
In a pan with hot oil, drop a little chopped garlic and let sit until you smell the aroma. Then add the zucchini all at once and stir-fry a few minutes until it gets slightly crispy.

Next I dropped a couple of tablespoons of canned cream of mushroom and stirred. Unfortunately it becomes gooey.
