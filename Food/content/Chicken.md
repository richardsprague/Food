## Roast Chicken

2024-01-22
Conclusion: spatch-cocking is always better.
I decided to roast a 4 lb chicken...sprinkle with spices (I used a cajun spice) and stuff with lemons and lots of butter. This seems to have made little difference. 

Roasted covered with tinfoil 1 hour at 350ºF, then raised to 400ºF without tinfoil for another 30 minutes uncovered, and finally covered again for 30 minutes



## Bone-In Chicken Thighs

Before cooking, cut the chicken thigh in ways that will let the juices leak. Use some of the trimmings as fatty flavoring for potatoes that you cook on the same baking sheet.

> Place 1 thigh skin side down on cutting board. Cut away any pockets of fat and any skin that extends beyond meat and reserve trim. Make three ½-inch-deep slits in flesh parallel to bone. Turn skin side up. Repeat with remaining thighs. Using tip of paring knife, poke skin of each thigh 8 to 10 times. Sprinkle 1½ teaspoons spice mixture evenly over skin of thighs. Turn thighs over and sprinkle remaining spice mixture over flesh side. Rub mixture into slits.

Parboil chopped potatoes for about two minutes with 1/2 tsp baking soda to break down the exterior. This will give them a crispier outside when you roast them for about 15 minutes at 450ºF.  Shove them aside at that point, and add the chicken thighs for another 20-25 minutes.

## Spices

- 1 Tbs chili powder
