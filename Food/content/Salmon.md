## Cedar-Wrapped Salmon

Soak the cedar wraps for at least 15 minutes (I did an hour) on a plate, just enough to get them good and wet.

Cut the salmon into a shape that can be entirely enclosed by the wrap. 

I lightly salted and then peppered the salmon pieces, and then laid down a fresh leaf of sage and rosemary. 

Tie the wraps closely with thread and set both cedar wraps on tinfoil and lay on the grill, indirect heat. Pour some water on the tinfoil.

After about 20 minutes, take the wraps off indirect heat and place on *direct* heat at the lowest setting.  Drip water on them, and flip occasionally.

Total time = about 30 minutes.
