![Harissa-Spiced Salmon with Pearl Couscous](SalmonPankoCouscous.jpeg)


_Serves 2_

This dish marries the warming spices of North Africa with the comfort of perfectly cooked salmon and vegetables. The key is building layers of flavor: a harissa-based marinade enhanced with ras el hanout, pearl couscous scented with authentic spice blends, and crispy prosciutto that ties it all together. The result is restaurant-quality complexity that comes together in about 30 minutes of active cooking.

## Ingredients

**For the salmon:**

- 2 skin-on salmon fillets (about 6 ounces each)
- 1 to 2 tablespoons harissa paste
- 1 teaspoon ras el hanout
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon tajine spice mix
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Juice of ½ lemon
- Salt to taste
- ¼ cup panko breadcrumbs
- 2 to 3 thin slices prosciutto, torn into pieces

**For the pearl couscous:**

- 1 cup Israeli-style pearl couscous
- 1¾ cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ small onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ to 1 teaspoon couscous spice mix
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

**For the broccoli:**

- 1 large head broccoli, cut into florets
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ cup crumbled Mexican cheese (queso fresco or similar)
- Salt to taste

**For garnish:**

- Dried rose petals
- Fresh lemon wedges

## Method

1. **Marinate the salmon:** In a small bowl, whisk together harissa, ras el hanout, cumin, tajine mix, olive oil, and lemon juice. Season salmon fillets with salt, then coat with marinade. Let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, up to 2 hours.
    
2. **Heat the oven** to 400 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
    
3. **Prepare the broccoli:** Toss broccoli florets with olive oil, cumin, and salt. Spread on one prepared baking sheet. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, until edges are crispy and stems are tender.
    
4. **Make the couscous:** While broccoli roasts, heat olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add couscous and toast, stirring frequently, until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in couscous spice mix, then carefully add hot broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until tender and liquid is absorbed, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.
    
5. **Cook the salmon:** About 15 minutes before serving, place marinated salmon skin-side down on second prepared baking sheet. Mix panko with a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle over salmon. Roast for 7 to 8 minutes. Scatter torn prosciutto pieces over salmon and continue cooking until fish flakes easily and internal temperature reaches 125 to 130 degrees, 3 to 4 minutes more.
    
6. **Finish and serve:** Remove broccoli from oven and immediately sprinkle with crumbled cheese. Spread couscous on serving plates, top with salmon, and arrange broccoli alongside. Garnish with rose petals and serve with lemon wedges.
    

## Cook's Notes

- Pearl couscous (also called Israeli couscous) has a heartier texture than regular couscous and won't get mushy. If using regular couscous, reduce liquid and cooking time according to package directions.
- The spice blend can be adjusted to taste—start conservatively with the tajine mix as some blends are quite potent.
- Scoring the salmon skin lightly with a knife prevents curling during cooking.
- For a dairy-free version, omit the cheese or substitute with toasted pine nuts.

## Appendix: Cook's Experience Notes

**June 17, 2025**

**12:00 PM:** Began marinating salmon with custom spice blend using Christmas gift spice collection from Mondspice. Used approximately 1 hour marination time.

**6:00 PM:** Preheated oven to 400°F. Started broccoli prep and got it into oven first for 25-minute roast time. Simultaneously began pearl couscous preparation—toasting method worked excellently for developing nutty flavor base.

**6:15 PM:** Added salmon to oven with panko crust as planned. Timing coordination between multiple dishes proved manageable with staggered start times.

**6:22 PM:** Added torn prosciutto pieces to salmon for final crisping phase.

**6:30 PM:** All components finished simultaneously. The rose petal garnish from the spice collection added an unexpected but successful floral note that complemented the ras el hanout.

**Post-meal notes:** The layered approach with prosciutto over panko worked perfectly—no burning issues. The couscous spice mix was more potent than expected; next time might reduce to ¾ teaspoon. Skin-on salmon roasted beautifully without any kitchen odor concerns. Overall timing strategy successful for weeknight execution.

**Substitution considerations for future:** Could easily adapt for guests by scaling up. The marinade would work equally well with chicken thighs or lamb. Vegetarian version possible using the spiced couscous as base with roasted vegetables and omitting the fish/prosciutto elements.
