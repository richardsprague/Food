title: Instant Pot Bone Broth

I put a leftover roast duck carcass into the Instant Pot with a bag of some Walmart frozen mirepoix plus a bunch of salt, pepper, and a bay leaf. High pressure, 100 minutes, natural release.

It turned out okay. Not very flavorful (needs more salt?). The meat came easily off the bones, but there were tiny bones all over, which makes it difficult to reuse the meat without manually plucking out the bones.
