---

A  nutritious seed that can be cooked and eaten like a grain, quinoa has a nutty flavor and a crunchy texture. It is also a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids that your body cannot make on its own

One cup (185 grams) of cooked quinoa has 222 calories, 8 grams of protein, 5 grams of fiber, and 39 grams of carbohydrates. It has a low glycemic index of 53, which means it does not cause a rapid spike in blood sugar levels after eating. Fiber and protein also help you feel full and satisfied for longer, which may help with weight management.

### Instructions

Prepare using 2x liquid to grain. 

It cooks quickly -- 15 minutes or less -- so watch the pot carefully to avoid burning.

### Ingredients

Throw in some raisins before or after cooking to give some chewy and sweet flavor.
