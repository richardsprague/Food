Ingredients:

- 3 tablespoons honey
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons ketchup
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 (6 ounce) thick-cut boneless pork loin chops

Instructions:

- Whisk honey, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ketchup, ginger, onion powder, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl.
- Pour 1/2 of the marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, turning occasionally, for 4 to 8 hours. Refrigerate remaining marinade in the bowl.
- Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
- Remove pork chops from marinade and shake off excess. Discard the marinade from the plastic bag.
- Grill chops on the preheated grill, basting with some of the reserved marinade until meat is browned, no longer pink inside, and shows good grill marks, 8 to 10 minutes per side.
- Pour remaining reserved marinade into a saucepan over medium heat, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook marinade until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes, stirring constantly; serve sauce with chops.
