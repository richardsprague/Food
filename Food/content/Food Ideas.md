### Cooking Methods & Techniques:

- **Sous Vide Pork Loin Chops**: Set your sous vide to 140°F (60°C) and cook for at least one hour.
- **Shrimp Tacos**: Consider flash frying the shrimp with high heat to get a slight char.
- **Ribeye Steak**: Aim for a high heat on your gas grill, looking for an internal temperature of around 130-135°F (55-57°C) for medium-rare.
- **Italian Sausage Stir Fry**: Opt for a wok or heavy-bottomed pan, cook sausage first and then sauté the bell peppers.
- **Shrimp Enchiladas**: Use enchilada sauce as both a marinade for the shrimp and a sauce for the dish.

Remember, these are just high-level suggestions. Given your culinary background and well-stocked kitchen, feel free to infuse more complex flavors as you see fit, especially drawing from your favored Chinese Yunnan and Mexican Oaxacan cuisines.
