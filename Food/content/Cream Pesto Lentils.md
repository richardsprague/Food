Creamy Pesto Lentils with Sour Cream and Peas


via [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/c/bf7baf4e-5db0-4d7b-880a-9e677338cec1)

1. Cook one cup of lentils, with a can of chicken broth and 1.5 cups of water. Cook until it's partially soft, but don't go all the way.

2. On a cast iron skillet, spread some cooking oil and a teaspoon or two of cumin, red pepper flakes, pepper, salt, and chopped garlic.

3. Drain and then plop the cooked lentils right onto the skillet.  Mix well. Maybe add some cooking wine and let it simmer for a bit.

4. Add a dollop of sour cream, and another couple tablespoons of pesto. Continue to mix and taste, adjusting the seasoning as necessary.

Serve the whole thing on a salt & pepper salmon.
