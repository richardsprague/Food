You can certainly adapt the Green Bean Casserole with a Chinese twist using the ingredients you have on hand. Canned mushrooms can serve as a substitute for shiitake mushrooms, and the condensed French onion soup can add both flavor and moisture to the dish. Here's how to modify the recipe:

### Modified Ingredients

#### For the Green Beans
- 1 lb green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
- Salt, for blanching

#### For the Mushroom-Onion Sauce
- 1 can of mushrooms, drained
- 1 can of condensed French onion soup
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1-inch piece of ginger, minced
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch, mixed with 2 tablespoons water (optional, for thickening)
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil

#### For the Topping
- 1 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder

#### Optional
- 1 teaspoon Szechuan peppercorns, ground (for added heat and complexity)

### Modified Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Blanch Green Beans**: Boil a pot of salted water and blanch the green beans for 3-4 minutes until they are bright green but still crisp. Drain and set aside.

3. **Prepare Mushroom-Onion Sauce**:
    - Heat sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat.
    - Add minced ginger and sauté until fragrant.
    - Add the drained canned mushrooms and sauté for a couple of minutes.
    - Stir in the can of condensed French onion soup, soy sauce, and oyster sauce.
    - If you prefer a thicker sauce, add the cornstarch-water mixture and stir until the sauce thickens.
  
4. **Combine and Layer**:
    - In a mixing bowl, combine the blanched green beans and mushroom-onion sauce.
    - Transfer the mixture to a casserole dish, spreading it out evenly.

5. **Prepare Topping**:
    - In a separate bowl, mix panko breadcrumbs with melted butter and Chinese five-spice powder. Optionally, add ground Szechuan peppercorns for extra kick.
    - Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the green beans in the casserole dish.

6. **Bake**:
    - Place the casserole dish in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling.

7. **Serve**: Allow the casserole to cool for a few minutes before serving.

### Customization Tips

- **Spices**: If you have star anise or fennel seeds, consider adding them to the sauce for added complexity.
  
- **Texture**: Given that canned mushrooms are generally softer than fresh ones, you might consider adding other textural elements like water chestnuts or bamboo shoots if you have them.

This adapted recipe should allow you to create a fusion Green Bean Casserole with the ingredients you have, while still incorporating Chinese flavors. Enjoy your cooking!
