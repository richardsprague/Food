Eggplant adds flavor and texture. It is low in calories (25 per 100g) and fat (0.2g per 100g), but rich in fiber (3g per 100g), potassium (229mg per 100g), and antioxidants. Eggplant may also support bone health with its manganese content (0.2mg per 100g), blood sugar control with its polyphenols, and cancer prevention with its anthocyanins.

## Grilled Eggplant

2023-09-25 7:26 PM
I douse the eggplant with olive oil, then shook the bag with some parmesan/breadcrumb mixture. It just doesn't stick that well.

Next time: maybe apply sour cream or something to make the eggplant super wet.

I tried a topping of parmesan / sour cream. Nope, not worth it.

substitute gochujiang for the bean paste.  Tastes good, though Stowe thinks the flavor is too intense/spicy

Highly-recommended way to do this.  Slice a large eggplant into 8 or 10 slices, each just under an inch. Score with cross-hatches, being careful not to go all the way through (or the pieces will fall out).  Smother with olive oil and lay on a hot gas grill under direct heat.

Leave for 5 minutes or so, and then flip. Adjust time accordingly.


### Topping

Mix the following and then spread over the eggplant after grilling:

- 2 tablespoons Chinkiang vinegar
- 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or water)
- 1 tablespoon spicy fermented bean paste doubanjiang
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 4 tablespoons peanut oil (or vegetable oil)
- chopped garlic
- chopped ginger

The ginger makes the flavor, so be generous.

## Baked Eggplant

2023-04-10
I doused sliced eggplant with olive oil, and then tried to slop on some breadcrumbs but it didn't stick well.

Next time: consider soaking 30 minutes in salt water, then bake at 350ºF for 15 minutes and top with chopped tomatoes or basil (see [Spruce Eats](https://www.thespruceeats.com/baked-eggplant-recipe-2216261))

## Miso Eggplant

2023-01-24 7:26 PM
Tastes great, though Stowe thinks it's a little heavy on the spicy (I used gochujiang instead of chili paste, and maybe a little too much)

I was going to do this...
