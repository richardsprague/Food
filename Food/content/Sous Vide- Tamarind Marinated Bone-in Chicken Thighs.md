## Tamarind Marinated Bone-in Chicken Thighs
Koji overnight, then let to dry at room temperature exposed to air for 3 hours.

then I added some ginger and 1 TBS of tamarind

Sous vide at 141ºF, set for 3 hours but it ended up going for 5 hours.

Letting it sit and cool for an hour, I then put it in a 350º oven with the broiler on HI for about 10 minutes to crisp everything. I laid it over a bed of chopped, sauteed cabbage.

Next time try hard to make the sous vide only 3 hours.

I tried the following ingredients, marinated for 8 hours:

- Tamarind (1 Tbs): I used Tamicon Tamarind Concentrate
- ginger  (half thumb sized, grated)
- 2 garlic cloves (crushed)
- lemon juice (1 Tbs)  [next time use less, or maybe skip]

For aroma

- oregano/basil for aroma (1 Tbs each)
- black pepper (1/2 Tbs)

Other

- Red Thai curry paste (1/2 Tbs): to give it a little kick and add more to that southeast Asian flavor:
- Peanut oil (1 Tbs): to increase skin flammability to make it easier to grill later.

You can also try peanuts, preferably roasted slightly and chopped, maybe pureed.

Roasted for about 20 minutes (flip at 10 min) in an oven pre-heated to 400, and then let it sit for 10+ minutes.

Also highly recommend putting it on a bed of cabbage to soak up the chicken juices.

Next time:

Sous vide at 141 C for 3 hours.  I want to keep it on the low side, to preserve as much fat and juiciness as possible.

Then throw it on the grill, but not for long (because you don’t want to overcook it).

You can sous vide it and then let it cool, either because you made it earlier in the day or on a previous day, perhaps even freezing it for use weeks or months from now. Either way, starting it cold on a grill helps prevent it from overcooking, but you must also be careful of the opposite: a piece of chicken that’s hot on the outside but not on the inside.
