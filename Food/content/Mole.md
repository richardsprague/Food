## Instructions 
2023-03-07

### Prepare chicken breast
1. Put a couple tablespoons of flour into a cup and add 1/4 teaspoon of salt, pepper, and maybe something like cinnamon (to give it a little kick).
2. Take a chicken breast and shake some of the flour mixture all over it.
3. Gently sauté on a fry pan for about 2-3 minutes each side. 
4. Take the chicken out of the pan and set aside.

### Make the mole
Add roughly 3-4x liquid to whatever amount of mole you start with.
1. Dice a small tomato into pieces and toss into the frypan you used to prepare the chicken breast. Sauté for 30 seconds or so, tossing in a little salt & pepper.
2. Take a couple of tablespoons -- maybe as much as 1/4 cup -- out of the mole bag and plop it onto the fry pan.
3. Add a few tablespoons of chicken broth while stirring the mole mixture.
4. Keep adding chicken broth, up to half a can or so, stirring until the whole mixture turns into whatever thickness you like.

### Add the chicken
Finally, add the chicken and let it simmer for a minute or two. If you have a meat thermometer, keep simmering until the interior of the chicken is above 135ºF or so. If you don't have a thermometer, poke with a fork until the entire piece feels solid and cooked.

Serve!

The pouch has plenty of mole, enough for many meals. This is how much was left over after making three chicken breasts.

## Variations


### Pork

I made the same thing using sous vide pork
![An especially tasty version with sous vide pork](https://sat02pap004files.storage.live.com/y4m_fUZNicc4IPEf8afaRibpUoAxvVon0dHj7JIYtBWsH6iHf7uQWabX4BUduKZc0jzVKVQgMGQ8Pka_9jBv5KRS8N09W0twWGhtKcKwfWkbR_nGLD1wR11-o8_5BerHe1UwSfErLtFBjw75p7AGX6NHESodZksjIglc5K8yDU2vqUL_1m4wGat9GNbTW3caeId?width=256&height=192&cropmode=none?no.jpg)
This time I used some thick leftover broth and let it have extra mole. Came out very rich, very tasty.

I tried the same thing, only with sous vide pork. Somehow it came out thinner and less flavorful, maybe because this time I skipped the chicken broth?

### Salmon
2023-04-10
We tried with salmon but it was disappointing.  I made the mole first, according to the above instructions, and that part was fine. Separately I fried the fish and then covered it with the mole.  The mole overpowered anything in the salmon. Plus it was annoying that the salmon had skin on.

Next time remove the skin first.

### Tofu
