A traditional Greek dish made with eggplant and/or potatoes, this is a hearty baked meal that will make up for its lengthy preparation time with several days of leftovers.

On my first attempt, I should have made the full amount of bachemel sauce. Thinking 2+ cups of milk was excessive, I held back, but I think there is no such thing as too much.

I started at 2pm and it took about an hour's prep to get everything in the baking dish. After that it was pretty automatic: into the oven for 40-50 minutes, then turned it off and let it sit at 170ÂºF to keep warm until 6:30 dinnertime.

[with eggplant and potatoes](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/eggplant-and-potato-moussaka-3644260):

### Prepare the eggplant and potatoes
- soak the sliced eggplant for 20 minutes
- saute the thinly-sliced potatoes and set aside.
- dredge the eggplant in flour and saute

### Prepare the meat filling
saute the ground meat, garlic, and oregano until browned. Then add red wine and let it evaporate. Add tomato paste, stir, and then add crushed tomatoes.

### Make the sauce

2 1/2 cups of milk
3 TBS butter

Melt 3 tablespoons of butter and, when hot, whisk in the flour and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring until smooth and thick. Season with salt, to taste, and whisk in the egg and egg yolk. Stir in 1/2 cup of the cheese and set aside, covered, while you assemble the casserole.

Optionally, mash the potatoes and just mix with milk and egg yolk plus butter and nutmeg.


### Final assembly

In a 9 x 13 casserole dish, place the sliced potatoes first, then eggplant, then meat sauce.  Douse with the bachamel sauce, and 1/2 cup of more cheese. Top with the remaining eggplant slices, and press down. Finally, add more meat sauce and cover with the last of the bachamel sauce. Sprinkle the whole thing with cheese.

Bake for 1 hour and let stand for at least 40 minutes.
