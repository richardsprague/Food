Leeks are often mistaken for scallions, but they are the milder and more sophisticated members of the onion family. They have a subtle oniony flavor with a hint of sweetness, and they can be used in a variety of dishes. Leeks are a good source of fiber, vitamin K1, and provitamin A carotenoids. They are also a good source of manganese, copper, iron, and B vitamins.
