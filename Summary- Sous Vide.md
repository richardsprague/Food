## Sausage

**2021-06-06**
150ºF for two hours and it's perfect. Inspired by [SeriousEats](https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-sausage)

Best part is you can just drop it without opening the original packaging.


## Cod

**2020-11-27** 

At 5:10 I set frozen pieces as-is in their wrapped plastic at 132ºF for 30 minutes. Came back at 6:30 and they were finished.

Apply salt and pepper, then pan sautee in olive oil for a minute or so on each side. 

Serve with tapenade or other condiments.  Tastes just fine.

## Potato and carrots

2020-02-21 

Chopped red potatoes into small pieces, smothered in olive oil, salt&pepper, black garlic.

Also carrots similarly smothered.  Place several spoons in the bag to keep the vegetables from floating.

194.0F at 1:15  but the vegetables were still too crunchy.

I heated the pot to about 134 on the stove — too hot to touch and even bubbling — but it still took a good 20 minutes to reach temperature.

Next time  run at 194F for 1:45.

**2020-01-05 Vegetables**

I tried carrots, organic full-size, with tops chopped off, with a pat of butter and some herbs. Temperature set to 194, but it took *forever* for it to heat up that high — maybe 45 minutes.

Also broccoli at the same time, but the end taste was more like it had been boiled.

I used ziplock bags, but it’s hard to keep them from floating… I added a spoon to the inside of the bag, but even that wasn’t enough.

Next time: heat the water first, then carefully add somehow with a weight
