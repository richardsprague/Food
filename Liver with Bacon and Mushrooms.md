Chicken Liver

I recommend only trying this with livers from chickens that are listed as organic or otherwise from a trustworthy-seeming source. Don't go for the cheapest.

## Insights
That rous is key: a tablespoon or two of flour plus butter, followed by half a cup of bone broth.

## Directions

- Pan-fry two strips of bacon cut into bite-size pieces
- Add onions or leaks and stir for a few minutes. Dump in tons of salt & pepper
- Add mushrooms and stir until softened.
- Remove everything from the pan
- panfry the liver (I used some sous vide pieces, so I only fried for a minute or two)
- Make a rous: drop in a tablespoon or two of butter and a few tablespoons of flour
- Add 1/2 cup of bone broth
- Stir until it turns into a thickened mess
- Add the panful of ingredients you set aside previously.

Result: very rich flavor.
