# Sprague Recipe Collection

A family recipe collection built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and published on GitHub Pages.

## 🍽️ What's Inside

This is our working collection of **tested recipes that we actually make and recommend**. Rather than aspirational recipes, this focuses on dishes we've perfected through repeated cooking.

- **65+ Complete Recipes** - Fully tested with ingredients and instructions
- **Technique Guides** - Cooking methods and equipment mastery  
- **Ingredient References** - How to use specific ingredients effectively
- **Equipment Documentation** - Instant Pot, sous vide, bread makers, and more
