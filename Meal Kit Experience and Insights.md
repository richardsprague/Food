A few things I learned from meal kits

[Sauces, Glazes, Marinades](Sauces,%20Glazes,%20Marinades,%20Rubs.md)


## Pasta
Save some of the pasta cooking water to add to the sauce later.

Italian pork sausage mixed with cream cheese and butter and chicken broth to make it creamier.  Tomato paste gives it a rich flavor.

## Salad
Make a dressing from some red pepper jam mixed with olive oil and some salt and pepper

## Couscous
Add chopped apples, and maybe some butter-melted sage after you cook it.

## Rice

Add a tablespoon of Mirin to (brown) rice after it's finished cooking.


Rice with minced onion, garlic,  turkish spice and vegetable broth plus raisins and lemon juice

## HelloFresh Experience

I cancelled again on 2023-06-05

Restarted our account on 2023-05-10 to have an easy-to-make set of meals for our upcoming weekend on Whidbey Island.

We bought two orders, one at a steep discount and another at the regular non-discounted price.  Total was about \$200 for 8 meals at 4 servings each = 32 meals or roughly \$6/serving.


5/29/2023 $159.63

5/16/2023  $37.16
